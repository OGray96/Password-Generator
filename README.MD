PASSWORD GENERATOR

For this week of class we were tasked with creating a password generator through Javascript code.

The user is given choices to individualise the password that will be generated. These choices are:

    - Length of password (Between 8 to 128 characters)
    - Inlcusion of special characters
    - Inlcusion of upper case characters
    - Inlcusion of lower case characters
    - Inlcusion of numbers

After a user is given these choices then a password is displayed on the page customised to those decisions.

Please see the screenshot below to illustrate the webpage
